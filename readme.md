# PorkSplosion

My first entry into the monthly Hedgespace game jam

## Theme

Fruits Galore

### Premise

The player will have to farm fruits somehow.  They will collect the fruits and load them into a
fruit-launching gun or cannon of some kind.  They will use this fruit-launching weapon to fire the
fruits directly into the mouths of their flock of pigs.  The pigs will explode into money.  The pigs
will also walk around, eating something that is necessary for the player to farm the fruits, but
they are also needed to reproduce, so that the player can continue getting more money.  Thus there
will be a delicate balance of farming fruits and exploding pigs, versus allowing the pigs to
populate enough to provide ample pigsplosions, without causing a famine that ends the game.  The
game ends when either all of the pigs have pigsploded, or the pigs have devoured all of the
necessary farming resource.
